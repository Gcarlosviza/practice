          Chucky has had many movies of him killing people but we never get see
          what pushed him to become the way he is. Later in chucky movies he
          becomes conflicted, he finally gets the chance to turn back into a
          real human but refuses. He has now become addicted to killing and no
          longer cares about turning back into a human.

          Charles Lee "Chucky" Ray is a fictional character and the main
          antagonist of the Child's Play slasher film franchise. Chucky is
          portrayed as a notorious serial killer whose spirit inhabits a "Good
          Guy" doll and continuously tries to transfer his soul from the doll to
          a human body. The character has become one of the most recognizable
          horror icons, often mentioned alongside Freddy Krueger, Jason
          Voorhees, Ghostface, Leatherface, Pennywise, Pinhead, Leprechaun,
          Jigsaw and Michael Myers, and has been referenced numerous times in
          popular culture. In 1999, the Chucky character was nominated for the
          MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the film Bride of Chucky. He was
          created by writer-director Don Mancini and is portrayed by Brad Dourif
          in both live action and voice over.

          Chucky has many fans all around the world. We grew up watching these
          movies as it was unique in its time, not many horror movies like it.
          So it later began to lose its touch by slowly transitionning to almost
          a comedy.

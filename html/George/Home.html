            Ever since the second Chucky movie (<cite>child's play 2</cite>)
            came out, the show has been losing its fear factor. Adding humor in
            and out of the sequels, then getting rid of it altogether. Even
            though Chucky felt no longer scary, I don't think it needed to have
            a <dfn>reboot</dfn><sub>1</sub>. I was interested to see what they
            would do next after bringing back Andy, who is the child from the
            first child's play movie but now as an adult. Hopefully, the
            creators of Chucky will keep their promise and continue the story
            but as a tv series.
